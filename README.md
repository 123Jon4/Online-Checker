Online Checker
==============

This application checks if you are online and signals changes of the connection
status by a short sound. It also displays a small rectangle which is colored
according to the connection state (red=offline, green=online). It is draggable,
scaleable and stays always-on-top.

Very useful for example if you have an unstable internet connection and want to
be notified when it breaks or when it reconnects.

IMPORTANT
---------

*Please dont use it all day long, cause I dont know how many traffic the image
hoster can manage, although the image is just 1x1 pixels.*

**If you are the hoster and have problems with my software just write me. I then
will immediately remove it.**
